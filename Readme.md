# Personal data storage

**Personal identity theft** and **hacking** are hot crimes in the **cybercrime domain.** In [2019](https://www.identityforce.com/blog/identity-theft-odds-identity-theft-statistics#:~:text=In%202019%2C%2014.4%20million%20consumers,over%2C%20have%20experienced%20identity%20theft), nearly 14.4 million people fell victim to identity fraud, which roughly translates to about 1 in 15 people. From hacking and violating personal files to forging documents, identity theft comes in many different forms. Blockchain can help combat this menace by storing crucial personal information (for example, social security numbers, birth certificates, addresses, PAN, etc.) on a decentralized and immutable ledger.

The existing centralized `Web 2.0` encounters key concerns like vending **personal data** to third parties, identity theft, mixing of passwords and usernames, and more. So, it can’t deploy a **self-sovereign identity (SSI)** for the users. However, **blockchain** can provide users with comprehensive control of their information in their ID and digital identities. So, Personal Identity Security is one of those use cases of blockchain that paves the way for SSI. ([upgrad](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/blockchain-technology-use-cases/))

# **Digital Identity:**

Digital is a term that has become ubiquitous in our lives, referring to anything that involves or is related to computers, electronic devices, or the internet. The digital world has brought with it many benefits, such as faster communication, easier access to information, and increased productivity. However, it has also brought new challenges, particularly in the realm of personal data storage and security.

Another important concept related to digital is digital identity. A digital identity arises organically from the use of personal information on the web and from the shadow data created by the individual’s actions online. A digital identity may be a pseudonymous profile linked to the device’s IP address, such as a randomly generated unique ID. Data points that can help form a digital identity include usernames and passwords, driver’s license numbers, online purchasing history, date of birth, online search activities, medical history, etc. Biometrics, Behavioral, and Biographic are models that make up a person’s identity.
